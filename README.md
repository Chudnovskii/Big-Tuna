# Phishing Awareness (Sanitized)

This REPO contains two directories, one for legitimate phishing templatese observed in the wild (redacted/sanitized), 
and one for custom templates that I have created and used successfully with internal tools such as Terranova and KnowB4.

Fictional, **sanitized** HTML examples for security awareness.  
No payloads, no forms, no real brands, and all links are safe (example.com or defanged).

> For training only. Do not convert these into functional phishing. (Obviously).

## How to use
- Import the HTML into your awareness tooling or send as static previews.
- Keep links defanged or pointed to internal training pages.
- Never add forms, JS, tracking pixels, or real logos. Because that would be bad.
